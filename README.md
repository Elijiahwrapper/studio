# GoAnimate Studio

Source code from the Legacy Video Maker of Vyond (original `go_full.swf` file can be accessed [here](https://goanimate-wrapper.github.io/GoAnimate-Assets/animation/414827163ad4eb60/go_full.swf)).

_Note:_ This has been decompied from [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases/tag/version11.2.0), the inner-workings of which I have little knowlegde of. If you're interested in modifying this repo's code and re-compiling it, I'd recommend using the same program.

It is also worth noting that the results produced here are NOT able to be recompiled. While this can be used to gain a better understanding of the Legacy Video Maker, the ActionScript decompilation/fla conversion provided by JPEXS is not nearly close enough for recompilation to be possible. This repo may, and most likely will, contain errors and inaccuracies within the provided code.
